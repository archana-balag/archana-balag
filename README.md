# 👋 Hi, I’m Archana Balaji

Welcome to my GitHub profile! If you're here to unravel the mysteries of complex datasets or just procrastinate productively, you've come to the right place. I'm a passionate data enthusiast and an MSc Data Analytics student who loves diving deep into data—especially the kind that makes politics seem even more confusing!

## 👀 I’m interested in
- Data Analytics (because who doesn't love staring at numbers all day?)
- Business Analysis (turning chaos into organized chaos)
- Programming (talk nerdy to me)
- Process Improvement (because everything can be fixed, right?)
- Political Data Patterns (yes, I voluntarily analyze political data)

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
🎓 I recently completed my MSc in Data Analytics at BSBI Berlin (yes, at 38 — manuals be damned).

🧰 Tech Toolbox

**Languages**
- Python 🐍 | R | SQL  
- C, C++, C# (because sometimes I time-travel to 2001)  
- Java (yes, the OOP kind, not the coffee)

**Data Visualization**
- Tableau | Power BI | Seaborn | Matplotlib

**Machine Learning / Deep Learning**
- Scikit-learn | TensorFlow | PyTorch  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
- Region-based CNN (R-CNN)  
- Object Detection using YOLO, OpenCV  
- VGG, ResNet-based classification (because pneumonia needed more than meds)

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- NLTK | SpaCy | RASA (used for building AI Agents with real-world use cases)  
- Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup, Selenium)  
- LLM integration experiments coming soon 🤖

**Big Data / Cloud**
- Apache Spark | Hadoop  
- Google Cloud: VM Instances, Firebase, Cloud Storage  
- Docker + GitHub Actions (used during my AI Agent deployment attempts)

**Tools**
- Git | GitHub | Jupyter Notebooks | VS Code | FastAPI  
- Firebase Hosting (for UI linkage)  
- RASA Framework (custom actions, slot filling, fallback rules)
    
🧠 Thesis: I built an AI-powered multi-agent system to support retail stores using cognitive knowledge frameworks, NLP, ontology, and real-time geofencing. 
Yes, my bot failed. And yes, it was hilarious. 

👩🏻‍🔬 Thesis Tech Stack:
→ Multi-Agent AI System using RASA + FastAPI  
→ CKF (Cognitive Knowledge Framework), BARS (Balanced Adaptive Recommendation System) , Ontology Modeling  
→ Firebase, GCP, CV Integration for offer extraction  
→ Deployment via VM (the VM fought back, but I survived)  


🚀 I'm currently open to:
- Full-time roles in Data/AI/NLP  
- Research collaborations on Ontology or Applied AI  
- Sharing my book bloopers if you buy me coffee ☕

## ⚡ Fun fact
- I proudly embrace my inner nerd! Whether it's diving deep into data analytics, uncovering patterns in political data, or passionately discussing the latest tech trends, you'll find me right in my element. Nerd out with me and let's turn data into something even your dog would find fascinating. Oh, and did I mention I'm officially 38? Yeah, take that societal expectations!

📚 **What's Next**  
- [x] MSc in Data Analytics ✔️  
- [ ] Publish first satirical book: *Be the Glitch*  
- [ ] Submit research paper on Ontology & CKF  
- [ ] Start GitHub series: “Glitching With Data”
