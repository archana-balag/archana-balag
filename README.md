# 👋 Hi, I’m Archana Balaji

Welcome to my GitHub profile! If you're here to unravel the mysteries of complex datasets or just procrastinate productively, you've come to the right place. I'm a passionate data enthusiast and an MSc Data Analytics student who loves diving deep into data—especially the kind that makes politics seem even more confusing!

## 👀 I’m interested in
- Data Analytics (because who doesn't love staring at numbers all day?)
- Business Analysis (turning chaos into organized chaos)
- Programming (talk nerdy to me)
- Process Improvement (because everything can be fixed, right?)
- Political Data Patterns (yes, I voluntarily analyze political data)

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
Still a humble student, I'm pursuing a Master of Science in Data Analytics at the Berlin School of Business and Innovation. And here's the kicker—I'm doing this at the age of 38, which, according to the Indian societal manual, is not "ideal." But hey, who follows manuals anyway? In my quest to become a data wizard, I'm learning:

- **Statistical Analysis and Modeling:**
  - R
  - Python (NumPy, Pandas)

- **Data Visualization:**
  - Power BI
  - Tableau (making charts that even your grandma can understand)

- **Database Management:**
  - SQL (because someone has to organize all that data)

- **Machine Learning:**
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow
  - PyTorch (teaching machines to be as confused as we are)

- **Big Data Processing:**
  - Apache Spark

- **Programming:**
  - Python
  - Hadoop

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
- Open-source data analytics projects (let's make data beautiful together)
- Projects related to business analysis and process improvement
- Research and analysis of political data patterns (because someone has to make sense of it)

## 😄 Pronouns
- She/Her (because clarity is important)

## ⚡ Fun fact
- I proudly embrace my inner nerd! Whether it's diving deep into data analytics, uncovering patterns in political data, or passionately discussing the latest tech trends, you'll find me right in my element. Nerd out with me and let's turn data into something even your dog would find fascinating. Oh, and did I mention I'm officially 38? Yeah, take that societal expectations!
